    War rages on. During an air raid, 16 year old Noah and his little 
    sister Renie seek shelter in a bunker. There, not only are they 
    protected from the deadly bombardment, but are also at the crossroads
    of a world between life and death: Silence. When Noahs sister gets 
    lost in Silence, he is forced to venture into this idyllic yet 
    threatening world to find her.
    Silence, however, bears its own scars of war and suffering. Dark
    creatures haunt towns and cities and ravage this once serene place
    between worlds. Only a small band of rebels stands against the 
    looming menace. Now it is up to the siblings to save Silence and its 
    fantastic inhabitants from impending doom and thus also save their own
    lives.
    Join Noah and Renie on their exciting journey through Silence where
    an emotionally gripping story of contrasts between serenity and 
    danger unfolds. Meet fascinating and likeable characters like Spot,
    the magical caterpillar who helps Noah and Renie on their way through
    Silence. And witness when the siblings discover that the only thing
    that can save them is their love for each other.
